        This resource is used to record detailed information about a clinician's assessment and assertion 
        of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health. It is intended for use to record information 
        about a disease/illness identified from application of clinical reasoning over the pathologic 
        and pathophysiologic findings (diagnosis), or identification of health issues/situations that 
        require ongoing monitoring and/or management (health issue/concern), or identification of 
        health issues/situations considered harmful, potentially harmful and required to be investigated 
        and managed (problems).

        The condition resource may also be used to record certain health state of a patient 
        which does not normally present negative outcome (until complications are predicted or detected), 
        e.g. pregnancy. Examples of complications of pregnancy include: hyperemesis gravidarum, 
        preeclampsia, eclampsia - which are captured as problems/diagnoses.
