    'description': """
        This Resource covers data about patients and animals involved in a wide range of health-related activities, including:

        * Curative activities
        * Psychiatric care
        * Social services
        * Pregnancy care
        * Nursing and assisted living
        * Dietary services
        * Tracking of personal health and exercise data
        
        The data in the Resource covers the "who" information about the patient: its attributes are focused on the demographic information necessary 
        to support the administrative, financial and logistic procedures. A Patient record is generally created and maintained by each organization providing care for a patient. 
        A patient or animal receiving care at multiple organizations may therefore have its information present in multiple Patient Resources.
