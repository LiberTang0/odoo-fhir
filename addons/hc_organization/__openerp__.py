        This resource may be used in a shared registry of contact and other information for various organizations or it can be used merely as a support 
        for other resources that need to reference organizations, perhaps as a document, message or as a contained resource. 
        If using a registry approach, it's entirely possible for multiple registries to exist, each dealing with different types or levels of organization.
